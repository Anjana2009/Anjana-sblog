It was he who commissioned the statue of the Maitreya Buddha, and he remained head until 1952.

                <p>This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. </p>

                <p>A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting.most popular of all Disney films thanks to it's revolving hand-drawn animation, famous and catchy musical numbers like "Circle of Life" and "I Just Can't Wait to Be King", and the Hamlet-inspired story that stirs up emotions all the way through for both kids and adults alike. I can't really imagine any other Disney Renaissance film as memorable as this or Beauty and the Beast. </p>

I absolutely adore this movie! I went to see it several times in the cinema and really got into the music, especially when Elsa was singing. Prior to 2018, I did not believe that they could top the first film, but after a while, I felt confident that they could. And when I finally saw it in November 2019, I was thrilled to see that they did! This is such a gorgeous-looking movie. As it is, I love autumn, and so the orange, yellow, and red leaves appealed to me. I not only love Elsa's singing voice, but also her speaking voice. Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell do magnificent work in this. I loved how Elsa and Anna discovered more about themselves. It's a great film about emotional intelligence. Definitely one of my favorites of all time.

Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, disaster will strike.And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than ever? Could it possible be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects… Harry Potter himself!

Take three friends. Add an old cookbook. Combine with cute boys and a pinch of magic…and see what kind of chaos ensues! When Kelly Quinn and her two BFFs discover a dusty old cookbook while cleaning out the attic, the girls decide to try a few of the mysterious and supposedly magical recipes that are inside. To their surprise, the Keep ’Em Quiet Cobbler actually silences Kelly’s pesky little brother and the Hexberry Tart puts a curse on mean girl Charlotte. Is it possible that the recipes really are magic? Who wrote them and where did they come from? And most importantly of all, when boys get involved, what kind of trouble are the girls stirring up for themselves?

It all starts when six kids have to meet for a weekly chat—by themselves, with no adults to listen in. There, in the room they soon dub the ARTT Room (short for "A Room to Talk"), they discover it's safe to talk about what's bothering them—everything from Esteban's father's deportation and Haley's father's incarceration to Amari's fears of racial profiling and Ashton's adjustment to his changing family fortunes. When the six are together, they can express the feelings and fears they have to hide from the rest of the world. And together, they can grow braver and more ready for the rest of their lives.

                <br>
              Toy giant Lego is aiming to put bricks made from recycled drinks bottles on shelves within two years.Lego makes about 3,500 different bricks and shapes, but faces the challenge of coming up with a sustainable product that can last years - decades, even.The goal is to find a product good enough that people don't notice the difference, said Lego's Tim Brooks.He did not specify how many of its bricks will contain recycled material, adding: "It's too soon to say."But he added that Lego wants to start using the bottle-made ones "as soon as possible".Mr Brooks, Lego's vice president of sustainability, said the two types of blocks should fit together and be interchangeable like any Lego product.The next stage will be to add colours to the prototype bricks, and test them with children and adult fans,.Lego said it would initially get soft drinks bottles from the US to make its new plastic toy parts. It said plastic recovered from the oceans would not be suitable as it is typically too degraded.

                <br>
             Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is off to its fastest pace to start a year since at least 2008 reveals data published on Friday by Brazil’s national space research institute, INPE.According to INPE’s deforestation alert system, forest clearing in the Amazon through the first two months of 2022 has amounted to 430 square kilometers (166 square miles), an area 126 times the size of New York’s Central Park. The loss in January and February year to date is more than twice the average of the past decade.

                <br>
         PARIS: Eastern Antarctica has recorded exceptionally high temperatures this week, more than 30 degrees Celsius above normal, say experts.
The Concordia research base at Dome C of the Antarctic, which is at an altitude of 3,000 metres (9,800 feet), on Friday registered a record -11.5 degrees Celsius (11.3 Fahrenheit), Etienne Kapikian, a meteorologist from France-Meteo tweeted.Normally, temperatures fall with the end of the southern summer, but the Dumont d'Urville station on Antarctica registered record temperatures for March with 4.9C (40.82F), at a time of year when normally temperatures are already sub-zero.
